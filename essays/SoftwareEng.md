## What is software engineering?

When most people think about software engineers, they may just think that software engineers are the same as the software programmer, and they think software engineering just means coding and programming.  However, I think there is a huge difference between software engineering and programming.  Software engineers not only need to do coding but also come up with some solutions to solve problems.  In addition, software engineers should be creative, they are able to invent and build new things.  Software engineering changes our lives.

Software engineers have been changing the world in many ways.  Software engineers change the way people pay for the things they buy.  As I know, in some countries, when people go shopping, they don’t need to bring their wallets.  If people want to pay for something, they just use their smart phone to scan the QR code instead of using cash or credit card.  One of the examples is the Alipay.  After scanning the QR code, the payment will be processed in the backend database.   Software engineers change the way people shop.  In old days, when people wanted to go shopping, they had to go to shopping malls or supermarkets.  Due to software engineers, today, people can buy anything online anywhere, and they don’t have to go to shopping malls anymore. One of the examples is Amazon.  Software engineers also change the way people take transportation.  In the old days, if people wanted to take a cab, they either needed to call or try to find a cab nearby.  Therefore, they needed to wait for a long time to get the cab.  Software engineers solved that problem.  Now, people just need to bring up their smart phones and enter the destination on their phones.  Then, the system will find the best available driver nearby.  One of the examples is Uber.


Due to software engineering, our lives are being changed and improved.  That is also the reason why I study software engineering.  I wanted to make some cool things that are convenient for people to make their lives better.




## How will software engineering change the world in the future?

Since more and more new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, deep learning, and computer vision become mature, software engineers can build a lot of cool things in the future, such as self-driving cars, smart city and smart home.  I believe Intelligences and robots will be the future.  I am also interested in these new technologies, and I am looking forward to learning them and using them to build something cool such as smart furniture in the future.
