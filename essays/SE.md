How time flies！It is the end of the semester, and I am writing the last essay for the software engineering class.  I feel we are becoming a big family, and I am very reluctant to leave my classmates and professor in this class.  I am very reluctant to end this class, but all good things must come to an end.  Looking back to the whole semester, I feel I have learned a lot of things about the software engineering during the semester.  The most impressive concepts I leaned for the software engineer are the functional programing and Development Environment.

Functional Programming is an amazing way to do programming.  In functional programming, we apply and compose functions to construct function.  For example, in JavaScript, if we want to find the sum of a list of the number, we can use “for loop.” Then, we can make a function like below:

```
function sun(array) {
 let Sum =0
for( let i=0; i<array.length; i++ )
	Sum = sum +array[i]; 
}  

```
However, if we use functional programming, we can calculate the sum with just one line of code.  We can use “var sum = _.reduce([1, 2, 3], function(memo, num){ return memo + num; }, 0);”  Therefore, we can skip the for loop if we use functional programming.  

Functional programming is very useful in web application development.  When developing a web, we always need to get the data from the database and filter the data to get what we want.  With functional programming, we can skip a lot of for loop, and we can combine some underscore functions together to make a function that return what we want.  It is very useful when we want to get and filter the data from the database.

For the develop environment, we use IntelliJ as our development IDE.  I used to use visual studio as my development IDE platform; however, after I learned about the IntelliJ, I have fallen in love with this new IDE platform.  I feel the IntelliJ is mush easier to use than Visual Studio.  When using the Visual Studio, I need to build and public solution for each time I edit the code; however, I don’t need to do that in the IntelliJ.  After I edit the files in the IntelliJ, the web application will update automatically, and I can see the change on the web page immediately.   Therefore, IntelliJ is very useful for debugging the error.  IntelliJ may be more useful than Visual Studio when developing a web application since we may want to see if our code work immediately after we add or edit a function.  I think I may use IntelliJ more than Visual Studio in the future when developing a web application.
